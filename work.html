title: Work - LLoyds
client: Lloyds Bank
project: Mobile 3.0
summary: I was hired by LLoyds to help replatform their existing mobile banking application and work on design and prototypes for the next version. I created style guides and a pattern library to bring cohesion to the app and design process, as well as new ways of working.
